# Puzzle-8
Solves the puzzle 8 problem

This program is an assingment for the Artificial Intelligence course.

The purpouse of the program is to type in an initial position of the puzzle 8 and them input the wanted solution, then, through 
heuristic algorithms the program (if possible) displays the solution tree, in wich each leaf will be represented with a small
puzzle 8, and only the solution branches will be seen.

In every leaf the puzzle updates the best movement and just changes the position of a number (and the blank space ofcouse). Say
we have the following output

1 2 3
  8 4
7 6 5

in the next leaf, the output should be

1 2 3
8   4
7 6 5

that's pretty much the format needed.

NOTICE:
Not every combination is possible, sometimes the solution would be unreacheable, in such case, the program just displays a 
message.

As you problably notice, the code it's not really good (neither my english), so advise and critisism is welcome, I'm here to
learn and willing to hear your comments and suggestions.
